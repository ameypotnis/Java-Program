Mail merge is a computer program or feature that allows users to create personalized documents, such as letters, envelopes, labels, or emails, by combining a template or a master document with a data source or a list of recipients. The data source typically contains information such as names, addresses, and other variable data that can be inserted into the template to create customized documents for each recipient.

Mail merge programs are commonly used in business, marketing, and communications to streamline the process of creating mass personalized documents. They can be standalone software applications or built-in features of word processing software, email clients, or customer relationship management (CRM) systems.

The typical process of using a mail merge program involves the following steps:

Create a template or master document: This is the document that will serve as the basis for the personalized documents. It may contain placeholders or merge fields, which are special codes or tags that indicate where the variable data will be inserted.
Set up a data source: This can be a spreadsheet, a database, or any other source of data that contains the information to be merged, such as names, addresses, and other relevant details. The data source is linked to the template or master document.
Customize the documents: The mail merge program uses the template and the data source to generate individual documents for each recipient by inserting the variable data into the placeholders or merge fields. This creates personalized documents that can be tailored to each recipient.
Preview and edit the documents: Before finalizing the merged documents, the user can preview and edit them to ensure that they are accurate and properly formatted. This may involve reviewing and modifying the content, layout, and formatting of the documents to suit the specific needs of each recipient.
Generate the final documents: Once the merged documents are reviewed and edited, the user can generate the final documents, which can be printed, saved, or emailed to the recipients.
